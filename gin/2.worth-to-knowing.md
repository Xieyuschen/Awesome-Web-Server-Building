# Some key concepts in Gin
To be honest, the code of gin is pretty and clean as it encapsulates the packages and logic well. In this article, I will overview the whole gin project and descript some interesting points which are deserved to learn about.

## Interesting topics
### how to handle the http request and how to enter the logic.
As http based on tcp, it's normal to handle http connections based on tcp socket in a web server. However, this action introduces the complexity unavoidly especial in http/2 supporting case. Integrating the web server logic based on the `conn,_ := listener.Accept()` and analysis http packet itself is not ideal even with the help of the http library.
