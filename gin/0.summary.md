# Summary 
Serveral mouths ago when I interview ByteDance Tiktok to find a full time job. And the interviewer asked me to talk something about gin source code but I think it's unsuitable for an undergrading student for requiring source code of a framework as I obviously stated I'm not know any detail about it.  
Ahh, just a small complaint here and it didn't affect any more besides the interview itself:) Back to topic here, gin is not strange for me because I have used it to develop [1037 tree hollow]() almost one year. In this stage I just want to step further to analyze source code of gin.  

## How to start 
I have read a lot of nginx source code and receive a lot of acknowledge from it. Some key points are important:  
- Learn clear about key structure in a frame work
- Learn module design for a complex framework
- Learn the whole process including init, request handle, memory management and so on

That's all and I hope I can have a great experience in gin source code's journey.
