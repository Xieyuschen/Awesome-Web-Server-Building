# Http module in nginx
## 1. Initialization of http module
Reading configuration file and then call corresponding callback will be ignore here. It just call those functions with order: `create_conf->init+conf->create_main_conf->create_srv_conf->create_loc_conf->preconfiguration->merge`.  
After this, it will do the following things:  
- construct static binary balance search tree for location searching  
- initialize dynamic array  
- call all postconfiguration of http module
- construct `phase_engine_hanlders` array
- construct server and virtual host to support hashmap
- construct connection bewteen listening sockets and server, set up callback corresponding to new connection  


### 1.1 Eleven handling processes of http request
The eleven phases are defined at `\src\http\ngx_http_core_module.h:107`. Based on my experience the http request is like a pipe and every network component can operate it. So the first question is:  
- Does one http request stay on those phase no more than once?  
--> No, it may be convert from one phase to another phase  


```c
typedef enum {
    NGX_HTTP_POST_READ_PHASE = 0,

    NGX_HTTP_SERVER_REWRITE_PHASE,

    NGX_HTTP_FIND_CONFIG_PHASE,
    NGX_HTTP_REWRITE_PHASE,
    NGX_HTTP_POST_REWRITE_PHASE,

    NGX_HTTP_PREACCESS_PHASE,

    NGX_HTTP_ACCESS_PHASE,
    NGX_HTTP_POST_ACCESS_PHASE,

    NGX_HTTP_PRECONTENT_PHASE,

    NGX_HTTP_CONTENT_PHASE,

    NGX_HTTP_LOG_PHASE
} ngx_http_phases;
```

- `NGX_HTTP_POST_READ_PHASE`: solving request after receiving full http header  
- `NGX_HTTP_SERVER_REWRITE_PHASE`: redirect URI before match URI by location
- `NGX_HTTP_FIND_CONFIG_PHASE`:  find matched location part
- `NGX_HTTP_REWRITE_PHASE`:  modify URI after finding the match location  
- `NGX_HTTP_POST_REWRITE_PHASE`: make sure that modify URI won't cause to dead loop. If redirecting times are more than 10, it will return 500 immediately.  
- `NGX_HTTP_PREACCESS_PHASE` : phase that http module can take part in to do something  
- `NGX_HTTP_ACCESS_PHASE`: Let http modules judge whether this request is granted to be solved further  
- `NGX_HTTP_POST_ACCESS_PHASE`: when `NGX_HTTP_ACCESS_PHASE` confirm to reject one http request it is charged to send response to user.  
- `NGX_HTTP_PRECONTENT_PHASE`: @todo, this position in book is `NGX_HTTP_TRY_FILES_PHASE`. Why they are different?
- `NGX_HTTP_CONTENT_PHASE`: handle http request phase
- `NGX_HTTP_LOG_PHASE`: record log after solving  


### 1.2 Who owns data member as `ngx_http_phase`?  
As old rules we look the interface of `ngx_http_core_module` first and then the others. First look at `ngx_http_phase_handler_s` at `\src\http\ngx_http_core_module.h:133` which defines some functions and then a `next` variable with type `ngx_uint_t`. We can think of it right away that it must be a lot of `ngx_http_phase_handler_s` in someone structs.   
```c
struct ngx_http_phase_handler_s {
    ngx_http_phase_handler_pt  checker;
    ngx_http_handler_pt        handler;
    ngx_uint_t                 next;
};
``` 
- so who manages `ngx_http_phase_handler_s`?  
Ahhh let's look at a few lines below and we found that it's `ngx_http_phase_engine_t` does this work by `ngx_http_phase_handler_t  *handlers;`.
```c
typedef struct {
    ngx_http_phase_handler_t  *handlers;
    ngx_uint_t                 server_rewrite_index;
    ngx_uint_t                 location_rewrite_index;
} ngx_http_phase_engine_t;
```
So the next aim is to find out who manages `ngx_http_phase_engine_t`. It's easy to find that the `ngx_http_core_main_conf_t` at `\src\http\ngx_http_core_module.h:176` stored this. ~~And it's no need to think that when this variable is initialized, it must be done in `create_main_conf` of `ngx_http_core_module` and configured based on `nginx.conf`.~~  
```c
typedef struct {
    //ignore some variables
    ngx_http_phase_engine_t    phase_engine;
    ngx_http_phase_t           phases[NGX_HTTP_LOG_PHASE + 1];
} ngx_http_core_main_conf_t;
```
Here we just need to know that `phase_engine` is initialzed and it corresponding `phase_handler`s are connectioned through `next`. They can be executed one by one.  

## 2.Details when http request in one of eleven phase
### 2.1 `NGX_HTTP_POST_READ_PHASE`  
When tcp client has finished to send http request header. Let's look at its checker function `ngx_http_core_generic_phase`.  
```c
ngx_int_t
ngx_http_core_generic_phase(ngx_http_request_t *r, ngx_http_phase_handler_t *ph)
{
    ngx_int_t  rc;

    /*
     * generic phase checker,
     * used by the post read and pre-access phases
     */

    ngx_log_debug1(NGX_LOG_DEBUG_HTTP, r->connection->log, 0,
                   "generic phase: %ui", r->phase_handler);

    rc = ph->handler(r);

    if (rc == NGX_OK) {
        r->phase_handler = ph->next;
        return NGX_AGAIN;
    }

    if (rc == NGX_DECLINED) {
        r->phase_handler++;
        return NGX_AGAIN;
    }

    if (rc == NGX_AGAIN || rc == NGX_DONE) {
        return NGX_OK;
    }

    /* rc == NGX_ERROR || rc == NGX_HTTP_...  */

    ngx_http_finalize_request(r, rc);

    return NGX_OK;
}
```
**Every http module who want do something on request at NGX_HTTP_POST_READ_PHASE phase must add its own function with type ngx_http_handler_pt to phases[NGX_HTTP_POST_READ_PHASE] with type ngx_array_t**. 


## 3.How nginx http module set callback to those 11 modules?  
- add callback function to the `phases` array
- call handler callback in `ngx_http_core_loc_conf_t`
