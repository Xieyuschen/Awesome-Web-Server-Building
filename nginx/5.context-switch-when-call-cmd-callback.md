# Conf_ctx and context switch when execute command's callback
This article talks about two main topic:  
- Why conf_ctx has four dimensional pointer as `void****`?
- How context switch while calling callback function?

## 1.Why conf_ctx has four dimensional pointer as `void****`?
It's easy to understand now for reading whole processes of analyzing configuration file. The fact must know is that **the scope of config can have a nested relative**. `main_conf`,`srv_conf` and `loc_conf` are all three scopes. Each module will create all of them and each scope will create all three which the outside scope will use a pointer to specify it. So all modules needs `void*`, main conf needs `void**` and so on.  
As a result, finnaly the `conf_ctx` is the type of `void****`. Very easy to understand now:))  
## 2.How context switch while calling callback function? 
```c
    /* set up the directive's configuration context */
    conf = NULL;
    if (cmd->type & NGX_DIRECT_CONF) {
        conf = ((void **) cf->ctx)[cf->cycle->modules[i]->index];
    } else if (cmd->type & NGX_MAIN_CONF) {
        conf = &(((void **) cf->ctx)[cf->cycle->modules[i]->index]);
    } else if (cf->ctx) {
        confp = *(void **) ((char *) cf->ctx + cmd->conf);
        if (confp) {
            conf = confp[cf->cycle->modules[i]->ctx_index];
        }
    }

    //execute callback in command structures
    rv = cmd->set(cf, cmd, conf);
```
There are following commands dealed in different `if` scope, refer to [this blog](http://www.xcstuido.com/2020/09/29/nginx-annotated-2/#ngx-conf-handler%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0).  
- `cmd->type & NGX_DIRECT_CONF`  
`ngx_core_commands`, `ngx_openssl_commands`, `ngx_google_perftools_commands`, `ngx_regex_commands`,`ngx_thread_pool_commands`  
- `cmd->type & NGX_MAIN_CONF`  
NGX_MAIN_CONF:`http`, `events`, `include` and so on...  
- `cf->ctx`  
The other modules like :`http{}`, `events{}`, `server`, `server{}` `location` and others commands in scope of `location{}`
