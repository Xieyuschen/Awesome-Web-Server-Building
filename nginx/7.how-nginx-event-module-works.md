# How nginx event module works
Before this article all of them are tell something about how config file is initialized for the whole nginx framework. Since now we will step the most important work as a web server of nginx and take an eye to it. We will learn about how nginx event module chooses IO multiplexing mothod based on operation system like `epoll`,`select` or `poll`, how nginx module is represented and so on.  
Nginx is a asynchoized event driven web server. As a result the core tasks of event framework are collecting, managing and distributing event which contains network event and timer event. Nothing could be more important than it in nginx.  

## 1. The exposed interface of event module, `ngx_event_module_t`  
First we look the interface of nginx event module:  
```c
typedef struct {
    ngx_str_t              *name;

    void                 *(*create_conf)(ngx_cycle_t *cycle);
    char                 *(*init_conf)(ngx_cycle_t *cycle, void *conf);

    ngx_event_actions_t     actions;
} ngx_event_module_t;

```
Different from other interface we can easily find that there is an action data member which every **event module MUST implement**.
