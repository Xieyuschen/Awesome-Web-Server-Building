# Who manages event module
- Reflection of article 7
In article 7 I spent a lot times to make clear about how nginx event set its hanlder function. But the callback function must be set and maneged by the upper layer of module. After figuring out the event module all works about event module can be over.  Pay more attention to event module itself and wish to get more information are stupid:(  
As a result we start to foucs on the upper layer of module which managed the event module.  

Actually, event module is a framework and the plugins installed on nginx will use this framework. So who set the callback in event module? All plugins will set the module specified callback to archieve its own business logic.  
**This is a great difference bewteen FRAMEWORK and application**.
