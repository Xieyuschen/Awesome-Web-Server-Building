# Summary 
This file presents my questions when I reading a book called `Understanding Nginx,Modules Development and Architecture Resolving(Second Edition)`. I render question prefix with format `Q(page)-rank`, for instance I will mark the first question in page 1 as `Q1-1` to quickly find it in the origin book.

- `Q162-2`: Why `reinit_request` is called after an unexpected tcp connection break, not call `create_request` again?
- `Q177-1`: Why concurrency in nginx upstream constricts by memory, not CPU?
- `Q208-1`: Which algorithm is suitable for large scale data collection to sort?
- `Q212-1`: When offset is calculatd in `nginx_queue_t` structure?
- `Q234-1`: What are popular hash algorithm? what is `BKDR`?
- `Q238-1`: Why element counts of hash in nginx is limited by `max_size`, what happens if the real number exceed the max?
- `Q239-1`: Why `ngx_hash_key_t` stores the origin key? Are they have been used in hash table?
- `Q239-2`: Who manages to construct Hash table?
- `Q241-1`: Where the data helps init hash table comes from?
- `Q255-1`: Why event driven model works well when a connection established? How traditional web server do to solve connection,do they use event driven?
- `Q257-1`: Are 11 stage in dealing http request a state-machine?
- `Q258-1`: How to split a blocked operation to a controllable time to finish(block a process is unacceptable)?
- `Q258-2`: Can nginx timer block process?
- `Q260-1`: How to understand gather many system call together to one call can decrease wasting CPU? 
- `Q261-1`: Why address in ngx_listening_s will store a addr_text_max_len to present memory add_text(ngx_str_t) allocated?
- `Q262-1`: `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` option will notify event framework after truely receiving data, so what if this option is not used?
- `Q264-1`: How to now how many files a process opened and know who are they?
- `Q264-2`: All modules can operate ngx_cycle_t, so how to make sure one modules operation cannot affect another?
- `Q269-1`: Nginx use signal to notify worker, so how to make sure signal won't disturb worker process usual work and signal safe?
- `Q272-1`: Why nginx process can own no more than 1024 worker processes? Can it owns more?
- `Q273-1`: Why nginx master will received signal `CHLD` when a work process exit unexpected?
- `Q278-1`: In nginx memory pool, assume a case that small piece of memory are quickly used and then expired. If we allocate 1kb per second and 1 day needs to 
86MB memory. So in this case why the expire memory cannot be reused?  
- `Q285-1`: What is file asynchronize supported by linux and glibc(implemented by multiple thread)?
- `Q310-1`: In the past, why system call `epoll_create` receives a arguments refers to approximately event number? Why now it needs this arguments any more.
- `Q312-1`: Why nginx use ET epoll?
- `Q325-1`: What is Shocking group? Why it is more child process, the case is more serious?
- `Q329-1`: After finish solving queue `ngx_posted_accept_events` mutex `ngx_accept_mutex` is freed immediatel. So what if no process listens the listening port?
- `Q334-1`: What does Linux version 2.6.x does, it seems that in this edition support many new features.
- `Q337-1`: What happened when read file asynchronized when there is already a same file in memory?
- `Q343-1`: Why MSS is ensured when establish a tcp connection?
- `Q366-1`: Why copy the origin value and then modify it when merge the config, this copy is just a shallow copy, what happened if the structure contains a pointer?
- `Q369-1`: Why a physical machine is able to own many IP?
- `Q374-1`: As `ngx_http_phase_handle_t` contains checker and handler and checker call handler, so why checker needs to contain a argument typed with  `ngx_http_phase_handle_t`? I think it can use it's struct address directly, as this pointer in c++.  
- `Q383-1`: It's normal to read config, but when the callback function triggered as nginx reads the full part of a module from the config file?
- `Q389-1`: Which module set ready flag in ngx_event_t? How to know when it's ready and has not read?
- `Q389-2`: Why not solve http request head and line together?
- `Q391-1`: How to use state machine to analysis http request?
- `Q395-1`: Why not receive from socket if there are unanlysised char stream?
- `Q402-1`: Why it's basic for executing multiple redirection?   
Set phase_handler to server_rewrite _index which make sure that it must restart from NGX_HTTP_SERVER_PHASE stage.  
- `Q405-1`: As a request not finishes, it will be handled the next time. So Where this request is pushed and when it will be handled again?
- `Q405-2`: Like Q405-1, the request will be handled when an event happen. What is this event?
- `Q409-1`: What event module can handle for some events? Is there anything besides R/W-able sockets and timer?
- `Q417-1`: What's the largest length of a request body?
- `Q419-1`: Does kernel discard the request body directly?
