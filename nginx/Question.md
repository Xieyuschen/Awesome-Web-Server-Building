# Summary 
This file presents my questions when I reading a book called `Understanding Nginx,Modules Development and Architecture Resolving(Second Edition)`. I render question prefix with format `Q(page)-rank`, for instance I will mark the first question in page 1 as `Q1-1` to quickly find it in the origin book.
