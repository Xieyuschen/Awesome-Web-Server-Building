# How nginx analyzes nginx.conf file
The privous article showed where the config file loaded to process, in this chapter we will continue to foucs on nginx.conf file and then find how it is analyzed.  

The function is more than 300 lines so I wouldn't like to put them here. Instead of it, I would like to give some examples to show principle of reading config file. An important function is `ngx_conf_read_token`, so what is token in nginx? Obviously it cannot be jwt-token in web backend development. Token is more similar to token in compiler design. In compiler design, token is also called lexical token. A lexical token is a sequence of characters that can be treated as a unit in the grammar of the programming languages. When it comes to nginx, token is very same.  
In following text, `user`, `www-data`, `worker_processes`, `auto` and so on are all token. For `#` symble `mutil_accept` and `on` are not token.  

```shell
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # mutil_accept on
}
```
Back to function `ngx_conf_read_token`, there is a `for(;;)` endless loop. It's easy to guess that it needs to analyze mutilple token at once. The things we need to pay attention are:  
- How `ngx_conf_read_token` analyzes token?
- When endless loop in function will quit?

## 1. How nginx represents file?  
When it comes to analyze token, we must learn about file representing in nginx. To know nginx file, we first review file in linux.  
### 1.1 File in linux
@todo: Read your book **Understanding the Linux Kernel** to see file part.  
### 1.2 `ngx_file_t`  
File descripter and file name are normal to represennt file. but the following data member 
```c
struct ngx_file_s {
    ngx_fd_t                   fd;
    ngx_str_t                  name;
    ngx_file_info_t            info;

    off_t                      offset;
    off_t                      sys_offset;

    ngx_log_t                 *log;
    //ignore some ifdef 
    unsigned                   valid_info:1;
    unsigned                   directio:1;
};
```


```c
typedef struct {
    ngx_file_t            file;
    ngx_buf_t            *buffer;
    ngx_buf_t            *dump;
    ngx_uint_t            line;
} ngx_conf_file_t;

struct ngx_buf_s {
    u_char          *pos;
    u_char          *last;
    off_t            file_pos;
    off_t            file_last;

    u_char          *start;         /* start of buffer */
    u_char          *end;           /* end of buffer */
    ngx_buf_tag_t    tag;
    ngx_file_t      *file;
    ngx_buf_t       *shadow;
    //ignore some 
};
```

@todo: finish it after reading linux file.  



## 2. ngx_conf_read_token starts
In endless loop, there are some condition judges about whether the loop should end and return.  
- `b->pos >= b->last`  
b's type is `ngx_buf_t*`, this judge may check whether the buffer is overflow and should be ended.  
    - `cf->conf_file->file.offset >= file_size`  
    Check whether reading file is ended. So why file offset may larger than filesize? @todo: what happened when reading file and modified its offset value?  
    - `len == NGX_CONF_BUFFER`  
    Attention that `NGX_CONF_BUFFER` is equal to 4096. If len is 4096 and then function will return `NGX_ERROR`.  
    - Calculate left size and check whether it's valid  
    In this stage it reads file to buffer and then just operates buffer by calling function `n = ngx_read_file(&cf->conf_file->file, b->start + len, size,cf->conf_file->file.offset);` at `\src\core\ngx_conf_file.c:589`.  
        - `n != size`  
        Here if the size of characters got from reading file is not equal to the size you want to get, function will return with `NGX_ERROR`. **So I interpret that the outermost if condition will only be executed once which aims to load file content to buffer**.  


After reading file content to buffer, it's on track to analyze config file based on accurrency content in buffer. The condition judges here have five specified case and another else. Variables meaning are guided by this [blog]() 
- `ch == LF`  
LF is `\n`, if ch is LF which `ch = *b->pos++` so the line will be increased. If `sharp_comment` is 1 then set it 0 for line ending here.    
- `sharp_comment`  
If flag value sharp_comment is 1, it means that there is a LF charactor at beginning of this line. So just continue the loop and then skip the following charactor until encouteres a LF and set `sharp_commennt` 0.    
- `quoted`  
Quoted a flag and quote is charactor `"`. If quoted is 1 and then it will be set to 0 and continue the loop.  
    > Escape sequence, the character after '\' is skipped. Then quoted is set to 0    
- `need_space`  
It will return immediately if encounter `;`, `{` or `}`. Or set value of `need_space` and `last_space`.  
    > when the token is surrounded by single or double quotes, must follow the final semicolon is a blank, a semicolon, or take braces Right bracket ( Left bracket matching is not seen in the code? ). Otherwise error.
- `last_space`  
    > 1 indicates that the characters scanned before are all blank characters. That is, the starting position of the token has not been found. 0 indicates that the starting position of the token has been found .  

- else cases  
In else cases, it handles the token it found in config content and then set the token to cf->args as type `ngx_array_t`. So the token is found and save. **Notice that it's first put pointer to array and then set token's data member values**.
